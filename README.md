<h1> Password Generator</h1>

<p> This is a simple program written in python to generate passwords under a specified set of user constraints, i.e. it will ask the user on the number of 'characters', 'numbers' and/or 'letters' to be included in the password. </p>
<p>Personally, this minor annoyance is what led me to writing this program. Websites these days have gotten increasingly tedious in terms of asking its users to pick passwords, and I get annoyed at my password manager not being able to come up with the kind of password I need (yeah, looking straight at you, Keychain. Fight me!).

Anyway, this program will seek to address that concern. I will update this project in the future with a GUI, just to, you know....make it pretty. Isn't that what really matters? Looking pretty? Glad we agree on that :).

Here are some screenshots displaying the ostentatious, glamorous, dazzlingly stylish simplicity of this program.....</p>
